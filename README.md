## üöÄ Development

### Requirements

You must enter the API development URL in the _./config/**dev**.env.js_ file at the *API_URL* attribute.

### Installation

``` bash
# Yarn
yarn && yarn dev

# Or with npm
npm install && npm run dev
```

## üì¶ Build for production

### Requirements
- You must enter the API development URL in the _./config/**prod**.env.js_ file at the *API_URL* attribute.
- Remember to use the _./static_/ folder for assets that don't have to be processed by webpack.

### Build

``` bash
# Yarn
yarn && yarn build

# Or with npm
npm install && npm run build
```

### Installation
The command above will generate in the _./dist/_ folder all the files necessary for the web application. So you just have to put the **contents** of this folder at the **root of your website** and configure your HTTP server so that **each route** will return to the _index.html_ file.

#### Example with Appache
Create a _.htaccess_ file at the root of your website and write the content below.

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html?path=$1 [NC,L,QSA]
```
